## Hi! I'm Sherry
As a dedicated Frontend Software Developer, I'm driven by my passion for creating attractive and efficient digital solutions. My journey in the tech world is guided by my commitment to minimalism, which translates into my coding philosophy.

__ðŸš€ I specialize in:__

HTML & CSS | Javascript (ES6) | ReactJS | Redux | NextJS | Ruby on Rails | Styled-Components | TailwindCSS

ðŸŽ¨ Beyond code, I channel my creativity into the realm of artistry. I usually take on a holistic approach that combines logic with imagination, and this perspective allows me to see problems from different angles.
<br></br>

__Let's embark on a journey to innovate, create, and redefine digital experiences together.__
