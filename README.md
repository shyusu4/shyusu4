## Hi! I'm Sherry
As a dedicated Front End Software Developer, I'm driven by my unyielding passion for creating beautiful and efficient digital solutions. My journey in the tech world is guided by my commitment to minimalism and an innate artistic flair, which transcends into my coding philosophy.

__ðŸš€ Proficient in an array of technologies, I specialize in:__

Pure HTML&CSS | Javascript (ES6) | ReactJS | Redux | NextJS | Ruby on Rails | Styled-Components | TailwindCSS

ðŸŽ¨ Beyond code, I channel my creativity into the realm of artistry. Crafting both digital solutions and artistic pieces, I embody a holistic approach that fuses logic with imagination. This distinctive perspective allows me to see problems from various angles and deliver unique solutions.

__Let's embark on a journey to innovate, create, and redefine digital experiences together.__
